## 1. Introduction

This is a simple example of a distributed system using gRPC. The system consists of a client and a server. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with a message. The client then prints the message.

## 2. How to run

### 2.1. Server

To run the server, you need to have the following installed:

  * [Go](https://golang.org/)
  * [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
  * [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
    * [Go gRPC](
[...]
    
    )

the consensus logic
 The PrePrepare, Prepare, and Commit methods have been added to handle the different phases of the PBFT consensus algorithm. 
 The main consensus logic is as follows:
  1. The primary replica receives a ComputationRequest and broadcasts a pre-prepare message to all other replicas.
  2. When a replica receives a pre-prepare message, it validates the view and sequence number and logs the operation. Then, it broadcasts a prepare message to all other replicas.
  3. When a replica receives a prepare message, it again validates the view and sequence number, and appends the message to the prepareLog. If there are enough prepare messages for the same operation, it broadcasts a commit message to all other replicas.
  4. When a replica receives a commit message, it validates the view and sequence number, and appends the message to the commitLog. If there are enough commit messages for the same operation, the replica executes the operation and updates its sequence number.
  5. this is complete PBFT replica server implementation with the consensus logic. You can run multiple instances of this server with different replicaID and address values to create a PBFT network.# GRPC_SERVER_ADD_Worker_code
